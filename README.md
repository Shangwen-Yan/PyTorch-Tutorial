# PyTorch Tutorial
PyTorch tutorial codes for course EL-9133 Advanced Machine Learning, NYU, Spring 2018

## Notes:
We have 2 recitations in total. All the codes are inspired by [PyTorch official examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples).

### Recitation 1:
1. cosine_sim: Calculating cosine similarity of vectors.
2. classification: MNIST digit classification.
3. regression: Regression for polynomial functions.

## Requirments
Please install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) as indicated. Please be careful about the *version* of Python, PyTorch and Cuda. I strongly recommend Python3 instead of Python2. Before you run the codes, check whether your machine supports GPU or not.
