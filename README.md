# PyTorch Tutorial
PyTorch tutorial codes for Advanced Machine Learning, Spring 2018.

### Recitation 1:
1. cosine_sim: Calculating cosine similarity of vectors.
2. classification: MNIST digit classification.
3. regression: Regression for polynomial functions.

## Requirments
Please install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) as indicated. Please be careful about the *version* of Python and PyTorch. I strongly recommed Python3 instead of Python2. Before you run the codes, check whether your machine supports GPU or not.
